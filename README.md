# Programming Project Proposal 1
First, I'm proposing to make a mad lib game. I'll go through a short story/use various simple dialogue with blanks for the user to fill in. I'll plug user input in for basic factors of the story like name, location, age, color, etc.

# Programming Project Proposal 2
Second, I plan to make a hangman game. The user will try to guess the word by entering one character at a time. They will have a limited amount of guesses, and an opportunity for a hint if they get stuck.
