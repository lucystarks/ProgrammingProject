# Programming Project Proposal 1
First, I'm proposing to make a mad lib game. I'll go through a short story/use various simple dialogue with blanks for the user to fill in. I'll plug user input in for basic parts of speech that affect the story line like noun, adjective, pronoun, etc.

Second, I plan to make a hangman game. The user will try to guess the phrase by entering one character at a time. They will have a limited amount of guesses, and an opportunity for a hint if they get stuck.
